# About Me
Hello there! This is Atonu Roy Chowdhury. I'm currently studying Mathematics (with a minor in Physics amd Computer Science) at BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have typeset lecture notes of some of the courses I enrolled in. They can be found [here](/unimath).

Sometimes I write some articles on Medium. They can be found [here](https://atonu-roy-chowdhury.medium.com). I also plan to add them to [this site](/writings). 

I am a trainer at Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad camps. I'm also an Academic Coordinator of Gonitkonya—Bangladesh Girls' Mathematics Foundation. I was the leader of the Bangladesh team in European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO) [2024](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo13/countries/country76/). The resources I made for Olympiad Math training can be found [here](/olymath).
